<div id="About">
  <h2 align="center">About the game</h2>
  <div id="Theme">
    <h3 align="left">Theme</h3>
    <p>
      Through one of the streams of <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/piratesoftware">PirateSoftware</a> the themes where decided for this years Gamejam.<br>
      This year it's all about Alchemy, and Shadows.<br>
      We decided to go with the more literal definitions of the theming Shadows, and will be using shadow creatures/figures.<br>
      For alchemy we have decided to use the concept of Transmutation, combining elements to solve the puzzles and cleanse the corruption.<br>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="Concept">
    <h3 align="left">Concept</h3>
    <p>
      Shadow wizard goblin game is a puzzle platformer with an alchemical-magic system used to interact with the world in order to cleanse the shadows of NPC characters.<br>
      In this game the people of the village have been corrupted and all that remains is their shadow. <br>
      Through the power of Alchemy it is up to the player to cleanse the villagers and stop the evil source that caused this. <br>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="Platform">
    <h3 align="left">Target Platform</h3>
    <p>
      The chosen platform for our game to run on is <a href="https://itch.io/">Itch.io.</a><br>
      Chosen by the Goblin Lord himself, for ease of running online, and safety reasons that people won't randomly send malicious content through zips or other ways.<br>
      In the end, if we end up making this a fully fledged game, our end platform would be PC.<br>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="Audience">
    <h3 align="left">Target Audience</h3>
    <p>
      With the puzzle and alchemical aspects in the game, our target audience are those who find the concept of Alchemy interesting and those who enjoy turning their cogs over puzzles in games.<br>

  <div id="Engine">
    <h3 align="left">Game Engine</h3>
    <p>
      The game engine we chose is <b>Godot Game Engine</b> due to how easy it is to install and use, and best of all it's free!<br>
      Another reason for us to use Godot Game Engine is that we all wanted to learn Godot, and the game jam seemed like the perfect opportunity to learn. <br>
    </p>
  </div>

    <h3 align="left">IDE</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Godot Game Engine</b> comes with it's own build in IDE and we will be using that.<br>
      We will have to learn GDScript, but that's part of the fun journey we are on.<br>
    </p>
